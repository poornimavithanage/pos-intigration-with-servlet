#### The project includes the same functionalities with different technologies

## Built With

* [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) - The web framework used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - Used for testing API

## About technologies used in the project

* Postman

Postman is an application for testing APIs, 
by sending request to the web server and getting the response back. 
It allows system to set up all the headers and cookies the API expects, and checks the response. 
Productivity can be increased using some of the Postman features

2. Reduced boiler plate code
3. Generated queries

* Maven

Apache Maven is a popular open source tool that offers a 
convention-over-configuration approach to project build management.

*Servlet

A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities

Although servlets can respond to any type of request, 
they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers.
