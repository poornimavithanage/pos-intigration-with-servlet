# POS System [Layered-Spring Data JPA with Maven-Servlet API]

In this **POS System** has all the functionalities of a POS system, like customer adding,item management,order placing,order viewing and order searching.It consists of five main parts;

    * Manage customers
    * Manage items
    * Placeorders
    * View orders
    * Search orders

## Dependencies

* [MySQL Connector](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.21) - MySQL Connector/J is the official JDBC driver for MySQL.
* [Project Lombok](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.projectlombok/lombok/1.18.12) - Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java.
                                                                                          Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, Automate your logging variables and etc;
* [Spring Test Context Framework](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-test/5.2.8.RELEASE)                                                                                          
* [Spring Data JPA](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.data/spring-data-jpa/2.3.3.RELEASE)  
* [JUNIT Jupiter API](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api/5.7.0) - Module "junit-jupiter-api" of JUnit 5.
* [Java Servlet API](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.servlet/javax.servlet-api/4.0.1)
* [Javax JSON Bind API](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.json.bind/javax.json.bind-api/1.0)
* [Javax JSON](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/online-repo.2.5.org.glassfish/javax.json/1.0.4)

## Prerequisites

* Before use this application you must need to install [JAVA](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) runtime environment and [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database management services.

## Maven

> Maven is project/build management tool.
  
  Instead of downloading and placing the jars manually in the project, we can use maven to automate the process. We can define the dependency in the **pom.xml (Project object model)**. Maven requires internet to download the jars, which is a one time process.

## Tomcat Server Installation
 * [Tomcat Server](http://tomcat.apache.org/) - Tomcat 9.0.39 version
 
## [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)

> Why use??

 When you implement a new application, you should focus on the business logic instead of technical complexity and boilerplate code. Thatâ€™s why the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification and Spring Data JPA are extremely popular. JPA handles most of the complexity of JDBC-based database access and object-relational mappings.

## Spring

    * Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java.
    * The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Spring framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model.

## Servlet

    * A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers.

## Postman

    * Postman is an application for testing APIs, by sending request to the web server and getting the response back. 
    * It allows system to set up all the headers and cookies the API expects, and checks the response. 
    * Productivity can be increased using some of the Postman features
